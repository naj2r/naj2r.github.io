## Bio

------
Nicholas Jensen is a Fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Middle Tennessee State University. His primary research interests include public choice economics, the history of economic thought, law & economics, and crime economics. Most of his research broadly falls into two categories. The first category explores the effects of legal institutions, public policy interventions, and their effects on both Criminal Justice and economic outcomes. The latter part of his research in the history of economic thought explores the intellectual contributions of economists and political philosophers, and their relevance to economic thought today. For more information on his research, see the curriculum vitae in the link above, or the contact information provided to learn more.
