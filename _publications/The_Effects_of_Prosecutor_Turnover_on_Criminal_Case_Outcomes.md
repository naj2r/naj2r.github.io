excerpt: 'How does election turnover influence prosecutor behavior and the outcomes of
criminal cases? This study explores how first-term district attorneys (DAs) adjust
case strategies under unique electoral and institutional pressures to build pub-
lic credibility, by examining how new prosecutors signal competence to voters
through case outcomes, including plea bargains, dismissals, and jury convictions.
Employing a dynamic difference-in-difference (DID) approach across three U.S.
states, the analysis reveals that prosecutor turnover is associated with an increase
in plea bargain convictions as reelection approaches. In contrast to prior research
findings, we find that new prosecutors do not significantly increase jury trial con-
victions before elections. These findings suggest that new prosecutorsâ€™ electoral
vulnerability promotes a strategic shift towards risk-averse behavior, prioritizing
plea bargains over jury trials to manage caseloads and signal effectiveness. This
study expands existing knowledge of how electoral incentives and career concerns
shape prosecutor discretion and case outcomes in the criminal justice system.'
