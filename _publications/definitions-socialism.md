excerpt: 'Abstract: There is a long-standing debate about whether the central hypothesis of F. A. Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom (TRTS), warning of the incompatibility between socialism and democracy, extended to welfare states. The empirical validity of Hayek’s hypothesis hinges on his definition of socialism. We build on previous works contextualizing and interpreting TRTS by examining the common definitions of socialism, capitalism, and the welfare state primarily between 1930-1950 according to 1) socialist intellectuals, especially those Hayek was engaging in TRTS, 2) reviews and responses to TRTS, 3) liberal intellectuals, and 4) prominent politicians and other public intellectuals in London. We find that socialism was commonly understood to mean economic planning under state ownership of the means of production. Those advocating for the expansion of welfare programs often held that state control or ownership of the means of production was necessary to fund social redistribution. Our findings bolster the interpretation of Hayek’s central hypothesis in TRTS as being limited to economic planning under state control or ownership of the means of production.'
